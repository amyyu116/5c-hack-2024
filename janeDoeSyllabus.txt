Introduction to Computer Science with Python
Professor Jane Doe

Course Description
This course serves as an introduction to computer science concepts using the Python programming language. Students will learn fundamental programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and software development skills. Emphasis will be placed on developing computational thinking and understanding the principles of computer science through hands-on programming exercises and projects.

Course Objectives
- Understand basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, and control structures
- Learn how to write, test, and debug Python programs
- Explore fundamental algorithms and data structures
- Develop problem-solving skills through programming challenges
- Understand the importance of algorithmic efficiency and performance
- Gain practical experience in software development and coding practices
- Apply computer science concepts to real-world problems and projects
